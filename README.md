# QRCodeGenerator

This is a simple Android application built with Kotlin and Jetpack Compose to generate QR codes and download them. The app follows the MVVM architecture (Model-View-ViewModel) for maintaining a clean codebase and separation of concerns.

## Features

- Generate a QR code from user input.
- Download the generated QR code as an image.
- Uses modern Android development libraries such as Jetpack Compose and Kotlin.

## Tech Stack

- **Kotlin**: The primary programming language for Android development.
- **Jetpack Compose**: A modern UI toolkit for building native UIs in a declarative way.
- **MVVM Architecture**: A software architectural pattern that separates the app into three layers: Model, View, and ViewModel for clean code and testability.
